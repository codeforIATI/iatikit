Getting started
===============

Installation
------------

iatikit is tested for pythons 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.

You can install iatikit using ``pip``:

.. code:: shell

    pip install iatikit

If you’re on Windows, we recommend using `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`__, which you can get by `installing Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section>`__.

Once Jupyter is installed, you can run the following inside a Notebook to install iatikit:

.. code:: python

    import sys

    !{sys.executable} -m pip install --upgrade iatikit

Setup
-----

Once iatikit is installed, you’ll need to fetch a recent version of all IATI data
from `the registry <https://iatiregistry.org/>`__, as well as `the latest codelists <http://reference.iatistandard.org/codelists/>`__ and `schemas <http://reference.iatistandard.org/schema/>`__.

.. code:: python

    import iatikit

    # download all schemas and codelists
    iatikit.download.standard()

    # download all XML in the registry
    iatikit.download.data()
